<div class="comment"><font color="#000000">There exists a good middle ground in India too - companies that have some of the advantages that Infosys or TCS offers (like the extra comforts) and the advantages of a start-up working with more modern technologies. Companies like Bosch, Siemens etc. I worked in one of those earlier, and I am quite happy that I had that experience - both in my engineering career and in my life.</font></div><p>I&apos;ve moved on to a startup in the recent past. Even though I find it more fulfilling - I believe that it&apos;s a good idea for young engineers to experience that slice of life, atleast in a company that doesn&apos;t stunt your learning experience.</p></td>

<div class="comment"><font color="#000000">This is par for the course with Apple. I remember back in the day there was this super popular shareware app called Aaron that gave System 7 users a System 8 looking theme.

Kaleidoscope was synonymous with themes on Mac OS.</p><p><a href="http://www.kaleidoscope.net/What_is_Kaleidoscope.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kaleidoscope.net/What_is_Kaleidoscope.html</a></p><p>By the time OS 8.5 rolled around Apple introduced Appearance Manager. Which was no more than a total rip off of Kaleidoscope. Apple engineers even wrote an internal utility that would convert Kaleidoscope themes into Appearance Manager themes.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appearance_Manager#Kaleidoscope" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appearance_Manager#Kaleidoscope</a></p><p>The shareware author got zero credit. Zero money. He just got ripped off by Apple. In the end, though, Appearance Manager never took off. It was a combination of Kaleidoscope&apos;s momentum and the taint of Appearance Manager that kept theme authors from adopting it.</p></td>

<div class="comment"><font color="#000000">I remember Konfabulator and Watson (is that what it was called? The one that was ripped off as a new version of Sherlock back when that was still a thing), but I think you&apos;re mistaken about why Appearance Manager never took off. If I remember correctly, Apple just never provided external developers with theme authoring software or documentation for the theme format, because between the original DP period and the public release, they(/Steve) decided that they didn&apos;t particularly <i>want</i> to promote wildly different UI styles. They never even officially released the themes they had demoed, other than Platinum.</font></div></td>

<div class="comment"><td>Hi HN, I&apos;m the CEO of a small startup in the midwest (this is a throwaway account)<p>I&apos;m in the process of quitting my moderately successful company to start anew. I made the choice once I realized that 1) I&apos;m no longer learning new stuff every day by having to meet new challenges and 2) my current startup has created a great brand but is catering to a small market: After six years in business, it will not grow much further without a large change in product strategy. I would rather put it under different management than risk it just to satisfy my urge to start from square one.</p><p>For my next startup, I&apos;m currently looking at the ebook space or doing something having to do with daily deals, following the groupon craze but for a different market segment. I also have an urge to go into the app space, developing games or this idea of an awesome social weight-loss app I have.&#60;p&#62;My general problem is that I generate too many business ideas: I have a list of 50 or so put together during the last two months. I&apos;m passionate about each of them for a day or two and I need to convert that day-long enthusiasm into a long-term passion.</p><p>My current idea of solving this problem is to let it sort itself out. I&apos;m betting that I&apos;m in the middle of a process that will end up with me churning my ideas down to one single vision.
But here&apos;s the question: is there any way I can hedge this bet? Have you been in a similar situation and/or have any suggestions on how to put the process on fast-track?</p><p>I&apos;m grateful for any suggestions, including "shut the fuck up and stay with your current company, dimwit", if that&apos;s your sentiment.</p></td></div>

Worked fine; I mostly wanted to listen to entire albums, which mapped well to folders.</font></div><p>Then I got a Mac, and pointed iTunes at my music without backing it up first (because, after all iTunes was an <i>MP3 player</i>, and why would it <i>write</i> to my MP3 collection?!).

Yay.</p><p>Even when I eventually got some software that would use a music database to figure out what tracks were, there were a distressing number of tracks that it couldn&apos;t identify (hundreds), and of the ones it could, it mostly did so in a very literal way, such that I have a lot of folders like "Movie Soundtrack - Artist Name" with a single track inside.</p><p>Could I fix all this?  Of course.  Eventually.  Can you tell I&apos;m still, eight years later, extremely angry at iTunes?</p><p>Now I just listen to Pandora.  Screw it.</p></td>

<div class="comment"><font color="#000000">I would argue the opposite: The "security is mathematics" mindset leads to overall system designs that are often less secure. How? The mathematically inclined security experts fail to incorporate (mathematically fuzzy) human factors such as usability and carelessness.</font></div><p>Typical example: Require users to change a password once/month and there&apos;s a maximum of one month&apos;s time when a password thief has access to an account. True enough. So what do users do (and let&apos;s thrown in a requirement for at least one capital letter, at least 1 digit, at least one symbol, 9 character minimum)?</p><p>Month 1: Charlie1!</p><p>Month 2: Charlie2!</p><p>Month 3: Charlie3!</p><p>Month x: Charliex!</p><p>Meanwhile, formulations for password security that strike a reasonable balance between security and usability (and thus actually get used) are rejected immediately because of mathematical edge cases.</p><p>Here&apos;s my formulation for a balanced security approach for home users:</p><p>"Use a password manager to assign unique, random 15 character passwords for all accounts, protecting them with a strong master password."</p><p>I can think of quite a few edge cases where this system will fail. Keystroke logging is the most obvious. In actual practice, there has not yet been a case of a password database being breached due to keystroke logging the master password (at least not among the market-leading password managers).</p><p>In actual practice, taking into account human factors, this system is more secure than that practiced by the vast majority of end users. And far more secure than rotating Charliex! passwords.</p></td>

<div class="comment"><font color="#000000">It&apos;s a good story. From a naive distance (the only perspective I have to offer), coal mining is equal parts romantic and disgusting. We can worry all we want about sitting at a desk all day long, but our life expectancy has to be considerably better than a coal miners.</font></div><p>I do wonder if such stories become less likely (more difficult) over time. Ever watch the movie The Aviator? Average movie, but what struck me in that movie was that you had someone who knew nothing/little about planes, learn to fly, build planes and build an empire on them. Try to do that today. The cost of entry, the licensing, the vastness of knowledge..forget about it. You could probably spend your entire life learning about a single little widget.</p><p>Software is crossing that same chasm. Simple "i could have done that" ideas aren&apos;t as frequent as they used to be (although mobile computing has rejuvenated this many times over). Building software is becoming increasingly complicated. You can&apos;t beat facebook without being better than facebook, you can&apos;t build source hosting without beating github. You can&apos;t build a mobile phone without copy and paste (well...at least, you can&apos;t really sell one...).</p></td>

Licensing, regulatory and insurance costs alone prove a significant barrier to entry.

Look at how much more a doctor, lawyer, or account needs to know today than they did 100 years ago.</p><p>I also think this is unavoidable in software..though I might agree with you that we aren&apos;t there yet?

<div class="comment"><font color="#000000">Apple&apos;s new announcements touched so many startups it&apos;s scary. iMessage takes on all the free/group messaging apps that have been built lately. iCloud takes on (maybe not very well) rdio and other streaming music services. Airdrop takes on dropbox, box.net etc. Reminders takes on rememberthemilk and other GTD services. How about the camera plus app that Apple took off the app store for making the volume button a camera button? Now Apple implemented that feature!</font></div><p>The Paul Graham quote used in this article was spot on, especially the part about "...you may find that you were merely doing market research for them."</p><p>This is the problem with building apps on top of another company&apos;s API. You will forever be subject to their rules. Whether you&apos;re building on Facebook&apos;s API, iOS, or even Amazon AWS...you will always be competing to a disadvantage.</p></td>

Yay.</p><p>Even when I eventually got some software that would use a music database to figure out what tracks were, there were a distressing number of tracks that it couldn&apos;t identify (hundreds), and of the ones it could, it mostly did so in a very literal way, such that I have a lot of folders like "Movie Soundtrack - Artist Name" with a single track inside.</p><p>Could I fix all this?

<div class="comment"><font color="#000000">Apple&apos;s new announcements touched so many startups it&apos;s scary. iMessage takes on all the free/group messaging apps that have been built lately. iCloud takes on (maybe not very well) rdio and other streaming music services. Airdrop takes on dropbox, box.net etc. Reminders takes on rememberthemilk and other GTD services. How about the camera plus app that Apple took off the app store for making the volume button a camera button? Now Apple implemented that feature!</font></div><p>The Paul Graham quote used in this article was spot on, especially the part about "...you may find that you were merely doing market research for them."</p><p>This is the problem with building apps on top of another company&apos;s API. You will forever be subject to their rules. Whether you&apos;re building on Facebook&apos;s API, iOS, or even Amazon AWS...you will always be competing to a disadvantage.</p></td>

They deliberately held back on introducing even basic features into Windows for a remarkably long time.   Things like anti-virus, paint programs, text editors, photo management - even opening zip files - were left with token or no support for 5 to 10 years after they were no brainers in terms of expected or useful functionality.   Of course, MS had (and still has, though less so) a regulatory threat to worry about that nobody else does.</p></td>

They go on The Pirate Bay and download the torrent.  Preventing piracy means you need to prevent people from ripping the disks or streams in the first place... but the people who do that aren&apos;t "casual hackers", they are as hardcore as priates get.  And if just one person figures out how to do it, it&apos;s broken forever.  (I assume there are plenty of programs available to rip Blu-Ray disks now, since the key for each disk is known and publicly available.
